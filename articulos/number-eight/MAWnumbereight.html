There was a group of people talking in a small circle, it seemed like everybody was very interested in what was being said.<br> <br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who that person is but he or she must be frightening.&rdquo; one of them said.<br>&ldquo;Seven people and counting.&rdquo; answered another.<br>&ldquo;What if he or she is in this very school?&rdquo; another piped in.<br>&ldquo;Hey, chill man, that is very unlikely.&rdquo; another whispered off<br> <br>They were talking about a recent news story: there was a serial killer in town. One of the guys was about to say something, but as soon as he was about to say it, the teacher entered the room.<br> <br>&ldquo;Good morning class. Today I have some very exciting news. We have a new project for you guys.&rdquo; she said<br> <br>She said this as if doing work was fun, and I don&rsquo;t know why she even tries to get us excited about science but I know that she can clearly see everybody&rsquo;s eyes rolling.<br> <br>&ldquo;For this project you are going to work in pairs.&rdquo; as soon as she said that, everybody was already choosing their partner &ldquo;This is a very special task, it is very long, and it is indeed a lot of work, but I believe that you will like it after all. The project is an investigation of tap water safety, I want you to find out, what chemicals are in tap water and how that can affect our health.&rdquo;<br> <br>I really don&rsquo;t have many friends, so choosing a partner was more about who wanted to work with me than who I wanted to work with. It is rare when another person and me have a mutual desire to work together. But, oh well, let&rsquo;s see how this one works.<br> <br>&ldquo;If you could sort yourselves into pairs now and report to me who will be working with who.&rdquo; the teacher quipped.<br> <br>Everybody immediately went to the teacher to tell them their teammates. There was only one person left. It was Jack Alford. I didn&rsquo;t know him very well, but I knew who he was.<br> <br>&ldquo;Lucy right?&rdquo; he asked<br>&ldquo;Yes, and you are Jack.&rdquo; I responded<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. So, do you want to work together?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Do we even have a choice?&rdquo; I said laughing and looking around the room. I immediately regretted saying that, Jack was a weird guy but he didn&rsquo;t deserve that kind of comment.<br>&ldquo;I guess not&rdquo; he said looking towards the people that were gathered around with the teacher.<br>&ldquo;Yes, I will work with you. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Great, thank you.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go tell the teacher.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;<br> <br>I went to the teacher and wrote in her notebook that our team consisted in Jack Alford and me. I came back with Jack, he looked very thoughtful, I sat next to him and he said:<br> <br>&ldquo;Lucy, I think we should get together for this project, it is a lot of work to do in class, and I think the teacher expects us to get together, so you could maybe come to my house tomorrow.&rdquo; It was kind of like a question but the way he said it sounded like a demand.<br>&ldquo;Sure, why not? That way we could have most of the work ready before the weekend.&rdquo; I said<br> <br>The school bell rang, telling us all that the class was over.<br> <br>&ldquo;See you there then.&rdquo; he said as I left the room<br> <br>He stood there for a little while, just staring at me, stiff like an iron rod. He stood like a soldier and his eyes pointed towards me but they seemed dead. There is something wrong with Jack, the way he does things are weird, but well, He&rsquo;s just another 16-year-old guy, How dangerous could he possibly be?<br> <br> <br> <br>2<br> <br>I arrived at Jack&rsquo;s house. It was a big house, it was very modern, it had white walls and very big windows, a steel door that looked very nice and sleek, and a very pretty garden with bushes and very green grass. Everything about it seemed too perfect. I rang the doorbell, and he immediately opened the door.<br> <br>&ldquo;Hey! You came!&rdquo; he said while gesturing me to come inside.<br>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s up? You have a very pretty house Jack.&rdquo; I said, I was mesmerized by how perfect everything in the house seemed.<br>&ldquo;Thanks Lucy, that&rsquo;s very nice of you. Come on this side, to the kitchen, I have some things prepared for the experiment already.&rdquo; he said<br> <br>As I came inside, I was even more astonished than before. Clean white walls, white countertops, plain wood cabinets, a glass table with a very modern lamp hanging on top of it as well as some very modern transparent plastic chairs. I walked inside with my mouth opened from astonishment, I took some steps towards the glass table when Jack suddenly asked:<br> <br>&ldquo;Do you want something to eat? An apple maybe, or some chopped carrots, some berries?&rdquo; he asked politely<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have an apple thank you.&rdquo; I said telling myself to stay focused.<br> <br>He reached out to the refrigerator and took out a pair of apples, he picked out a very big knife from his knife block and began chopping the apples. The way he used the knife was somewhat disturbing, he was so good with it, I felt like if I even moved, he could throw it at me and kill me right in the spot. He chopped the apples with very fast and precise moves, I was very surprised at his skill. Then he took some plates out and put an apple on each plate.<br>&ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo; he said as he passed me the plate. &ldquo;Would you like anything else?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No thank you, I think this is more than enough.&rdquo; I said.<br> <br>We continued to make our project. We worked very well together, the project went very well. We finished most of our work. And it was still early.<br> <br>&ldquo;So, when do your parents arrive?&rdquo; I asked, surprised to see nor hear anybody else around the house.<br>&ldquo;Oh, well, I live alone.&rdquo; he responded<br>&ldquo;You mean, no parents, siblings, roommates, no one.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yup, completely alone, this house is all mine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re 16 years old!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I know, but well...it&rsquo;s a long story and it involves a lot of legal stuff but, in a summary, I get to have my own house and be my own tutor, so I don&rsquo;t need anyone to take care of me or my stuff.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool, but, how do you keep your house like this? It is super clean and organized and perfect.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s say that I am responsible, and very well organized.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That is cool, but also a bit weird.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Would you please just stop it with the questions, I am a normal human being, it&rsquo;s not like I am the serial killer or anything.&rdquo; he started looking a bit nervous, he straightened up and his voice sounded different.<br>&ldquo;Ok, whatever you want. Well, I should get going, my parents are waiting for me at home.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Yes, sure, go ahead.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Well, goodbye.&rdquo; I said leaving his house.<br>&ldquo;Goodbye&rdquo; Jack responded as he closed the main door.<br> <br>I walked home thinking about Jack, the way he talked, acted, it all seemed out of place, he had a big gorgeous house, that was almost too perfect. He lived alone, with no one to take care of him, and that seemed odd. But he was unnoticed, no one ever paid any attention to him, I mean, I knew his name, but only because he&rsquo;s in my class and I have seen him on the list of students, but that was about everything I knew about him, I have never seen him with any friends, he was different.<br> <br>He doesn&rsquo;t have many friends, He doesn&rsquo;t stand out in a crowd, I mean, no one would even notice if he disappeared. I sped up, and when I arrived at home, my parents were not there, of course, I have lived alone for more than 2 years. Many years ago, I was trained to be an assassin, just like my parents (who left me some years ago because of their jobs), I was very good, but then it went out of control, I couldn&rsquo;t go long enough without the thrill of killing someone. And just now I had found a perfect victim, one that would go unnoticed. I took my gun and silencer and put them in a bag. Then I went back to Jack&rsquo;s house.<br> <br>He opened the door.<br> <br>&ldquo;Hi Jack, I think I left something here, would you mind if I come inside and look for it?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; he said letting me in.<br> <br>He went towards the kitchen and asked:<br> <br>&ldquo;So what was it that you left here?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;An earring, I had it in my bag, it must have fallen off.&rdquo;<br> <br>He bent down and started looking in the floor. And there he was, victim number eight. I took out my gun and pointed it at him.<br> <br>&ldquo;You want to say your last words?&rdquo;<br> <br>He turned around.<br> <br>&ldquo;Wha&hellip;.&rdquo; he immediately fell silent, realizing what was happening. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said after a few seconds.<br> <br>&ldquo;Me.&rdquo;<br> <br>I pulled the trigger.<br> <br>The end.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tags: short story</span></p></body></html>
